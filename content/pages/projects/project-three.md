Learnings from Project Execution: Precision Renovation Cost Estimation through Machine Learning

Importance of a Clean Dataset:
The data source was retrieved from a government website, spanning several years. Inconsistent data required meticulous cleaning to align with the project's objectives.

Technique Used: Normality Check with Shapiro Test:
Normality checks are fundamental to understanding the data distribution. The Shapiro test was instrumental in guiding subsequent modeling decisions.

Preprocessing Techniques: MinMaxScaler, Encoder-Fit, Scaler.Fit for Different Data Types:
Tailoring preprocessing steps to accommodate varied data types is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring compatibility with the chosen models.

Interesting Data Visualization Techniques:
Scatterplot with Resale Price as Color: Highlighting price differences in housing by utilizing the resale_price of flats as a color indicator.
Animated Chart for Price Evolution Over Time: A dynamic representation showcasing how house prices evolved over time.

Measured Effectiveness Using: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R2 Score:
Multiple evaluation metrics provide a holistic view of model performance. MSE indicates the accuracy of predictions, while R2 Score reflects the proportion of variance captured by the model.
