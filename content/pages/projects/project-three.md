Digital transformation multi-pronged approach

1. 3D Smart Design Generator:
Enhance customer involvement and confidence in project decisions.

Integrate a 3D Smart Design Generator powered by AI, allowing users to explore diverse design possibilities. This interactive tool fosters collaboration between users and renovators, ensuring informed decisions before the renovation process begins. 

2. Project Management Interface:
Increase transparency and communication throughout the renovation journey.

Develop a user-centric Project Management Interface that facilitates seamless communication among all stakeholders involved in the renovation project. Real-time updates, progress tracking, and open channels ensure transparency and client satisfaction. 3. Blockchain Verified Reviews:

3. Blockchain review system:
Implement a blockchain-based review system to authenticate and verify customer reviews. This solution assures users of the reliability of testimonials, mitigating concerns about potential scams and reinforcing trust in the renovation process. 

4. Machine Learning Cost Prediction:
 Develop a robust machine learning model for precise cost estimation.

Create a sophisticated machine learning model leveraging historical data and predictive analytics. Tailor the model to accommodate diverse renovation projects, ensuring accurate cost predictions. This tool empowers users with transparent and reliable cost estimates, aligning with the project's overall goal.
Expected Outcomes:

Note: The combination of these innovative solutions aims to redefine the renovation experience, providing users with the tools and confidence to navigate the complexities of renovation projects while fostering a positive and transparent environment.

Learnings from Project Execution: Precision Renovation Cost Estimation through Machine Learning

Importance of a Clean Dataset:
The data source was retrieved from a government website, spanning several years. Inconsistent data required meticulous cleaning to align with the project's objectives.

Technique Used: Normality Check with Shapiro Test:
Normality checks are fundamental to understanding the data distribution. The Shapiro test was instrumental in guiding subsequent modeling decisions.

Preprocessing Techniques: MinMaxScaler, Encoder-Fit, Scaler.Fit for Different Data Types:
Tailoring preprocessing steps to accommodate varied data types is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring compatibility with the chosen models.

Interesting Data Visualization Techniques:
Scatterplot with Resale Price as Color: Highlighting price differences in housing by utilizing the resale_price of flats as a color indicator.
Animated Chart for Price Evolution Over Time: A dynamic representation showcasing how house prices evolved over time.

Measured Effectiveness Using: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R2 Score:
Multiple evaluation metrics provide a holistic view of model performance. MSE indicates the accuracy of predictions, while R2 Score reflects the proportion of variance captured by the model.
