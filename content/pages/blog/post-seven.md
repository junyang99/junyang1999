Having spent my entire life in the secure and stable environment of Singapore, the decision to step out of my comfort zone for an internship in ASEAN was driven by a desire for personal and professional growth. In this blog, I share my transformative experiences at InvestIdea, highlighting the patient guidance of mentors like Phillip and my colleagues, who played pivotal roles in my past month here.

Reflecting on the dynamic landscape of data-driven decision-making, my internship at InvestIdea has proven to be a pivotal step toward achieving fluency in the language of data. InvestIdea played a foundational role in equipping me with the skills necessary for a career at the forefront of data science. The team's expertise and guidance were instrumental in shaping my understanding of this intricate field.

One notable aspect of my learning journey was delving into the realm of database architecture, a domain previously unfamiliar to me. InvestIdea not only introduced me to the fundamentals but also provided comprehensive insights into data modeling concepts. This exposure significantly broadened my knowledge base and enhanced my proficiency in handling and structuring data.
