Six months have passed in the blink of an eye, marking the end of a remarkable chapter in my professional journey at Grab. Working on the merchant strategy team within GrabFood has been an incredible experience, allowing me to contribute to the success of thousands of merchants and reinforcing the notion that their success is, indeed, our success.

> Embracing the Power of Data-Driven Decision-Making

One of the most profound lessons I've learned during my time at Grab is the paramount importance of data-driven decision-making. Working on two key products, Teatime and Customer Lifecycle Management (CLM), opened my eyes to the transformative potential of harnessing data for strategic planning.

## Teatime: Enhancing GMV with Precision

Managing a six-digit budget for Teatime, aimed at boosting Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) during periods of lower orders, posed a unique challenge given Grab's vast user and merchant base. Leveraging tools like pandas and Python on Databricks, I successfully identified and allocated budgets to specific merchants, contributing to a significant improvement in GMV.

## Customer Lifecycle Management: Nurturing Customer Relationships

In collaboration with over 50 merchants, I played a pivotal role in developing a monthly coupon strategy as part of the Customer Lifecycle Management initiative. This not only strengthened our relationships with merchants but also resulted in tangible improvements in customer sales.

Happy to share that during my time there, the team managed to improve overall GMV by over 20%

## The Art of Data Visualization and Communication
Beyond technical proficiency, my time at Grab emphasized the power of data visualization and effective communication in translating complex insights into actionable strategies. This experience has been instrumental in honing my skills in presenting data-driven narratives that resonate with stakeholders.

## Gratitude for Mentorship and Team Collaboration
No journey is complete without acknowledging the invaluable support and guidance received from the team. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Javier Ong Bonilla, Sandra Tam, and Qi Hui Choy for their unwavering patience and mentorship. Working alongside them has not only been an educational experience but also a joyous one, fostering a collaborative environment where learning thrived.

>> A Holistic Approach: Technical Competency and Business Acumen
My role extended beyond technical responsibilities. Apart from providing data training to various account managers through SQL coding, I actively supported events and played a key role in stakeholder management. This holistic approach allowed me to demonstrate not only my technical competency but also my proficiency in navigating the business landscape.

## Conclusion: A Chapter of Growth and Gratitude
In retrospect, my time at Grab has been more than just a professional stint; it has been a period of substantial growth, both personally and in my career. I express my sincere thanks to Grab for providing this enriching opportunity and look forward to carrying these valuable lessons forward in my future endeavors.
