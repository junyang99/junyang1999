Exploration has always been a part of my essence, yet the confluence of the COVID-19 pandemic and military service stifled my opportunities for adventure. Following an intensive six-month stint at university, juggling responsibilities between work and school at Grab, I found myself physically and mentally drained. Undoubtedly challenging, those months were a testament to my determination to excel in both domains.

In a bid to inaugurate the new year of 2023 on a pinnacle, both metaphorically and literally, I resolved to undertake a three-day, two-night hike to Kota Kinabalu. This endeavor marked a personal zenith, a journey to the highest physical point I could attain. The trek, demanding and arduous, unfolded as a transcendent experience, leaving me with a profound appreciation for nature's grandeur and the satisfaction of conquering new heights. The serenity atop Kota Kinabalu ignited a spark within me, intensifying my thirst for novel adventures and unexplored territories. This expedition, a symbolic ascent at the dawn of a new year, not only rejuvenated my spirit but also instilled in me an insatiable hunger for the countless adventures that lie ahead.
