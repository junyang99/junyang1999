After seven months of preparation, my team of 14 embarked on a purposeful expedition, aiming to impart essential soft skills to the youth of Son Tra, Vietnam. As the founder, my vision was clear: to equip these young minds with a versatile skill set spanning Vietnam's economy, interview skills, goal setting, teamwork, basic personal finance, and design fundamentals, paving the way for diverse career paths.

## New Journey

> “The journey began with the profound lesson of resilience and adaptability”

Venturing into unfamiliar territory, we encountered unforeseen challenges, from language barriers to navigating local customs. These hurdles demanded quick thinking and innovative solutions, teaching us the invaluable skills of flexibility and open-mindedness in the face of adversity.

Beyond education, our immersion in the local culture and community was a testament to our commitment. From sharing knowledge about the region's wildlife with Child Clubs to gaining insights into the lives of fishermen and stall owners, we endeavored to instill appreciation and responsibility for the environment.

## Hundreds of childrens reached

In just two weeks, we interacted with hundreds of children across four schools, connecting with warm-hearted locals and uncovering a side of Vietnam we would have otherwise missed. Project White Dove left an indelible mark on our hearts, reinforcing our belief in the power of education and community engagement.

Our interactions with the people of Vietnam were a testament to the enduring impact of genuine human connections. As we departed Son Tra, we carried not only a sense of accomplishment but also newfound friendships and a profound appreciation for the kindness and warmth of the Vietnamese people. This journey, from vision to impact, epitomizes the transformative potential of education and community engagement.

## Leadership journey

Embarking on a journey from scratch is a profound challenge known to every leader. Yet, with the unwavering support of my incredible team, the school, government councils, and various stakeholders, Project White Dove not only found its wings but soared to make a heartfelt impact. Gratitude fills my heart as I share that our mission is not a mere chapter but a novel, with plans to script meaningful moments for the coming decade.

Although I've taken a step back from the role of a project leader, my connection to this endeavor remains unwavering. In the spirit of continued service and emotional investment, I have transitioned into the role of an advisor. This shift is not a goodbye but a transformation, as I pledge to lend my experience and guidance to future leaders who bravely step forward to serve and create lasting impacts in the community. The flame of Project White Dove flickers with an emotional resonance, and I am eager to witness the chapters yet to be written, each one carrying the echoes of compassion and change.
